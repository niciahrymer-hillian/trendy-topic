# Global AI Conversation Analytics Platform
## What the World Asks AI

**Capstone Type:** Data Engineering + NLP + LLM Analytics + Interactive Dashboard  
**Project Vision:** Build an interactive analytics platform that analyzes over 3 million global AI conversations to uncover what people around the world are asking, how interests differ by geography and language, and what trends emerge over time.

The platform combines data engineering, natural language processing, AI-powered classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, geospatial analytics, AI voice summaries, and interactive visualizations to transform raw conversation data into actionable insights.

## Quick Start Button in VS Code

This repo includes a one-click Run and Debug setup.

Use the green Run and Debug button in VS Code and choose:

`Start Trendy Topic Stack`

What it does:

- Starts the FastAPI backend on port `8000`
- Starts the Vite frontend on port `5173`
- Opens the dashboard in your browser automatically when the frontend is ready

If the Python interpreter is not already selected in VS Code, point it to:

`/Users/shocka/trendy-topic/.venv/bin/python`

## Dewey Indexing for Full WildChat

To stream prompts from Hugging Face WildChat and map each prompt into a Dewey class:

```bash
python -m src.dewey_prompt_index --dataset allenai/WildChat --split train --limit 1000000 --out-csv data/exports/wildchat_dewey_index.csv --replace-output
```

To write the same index rows into PostgreSQL (requires `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
python -m src.dewey_prompt_index --dataset allenai/WildChat --split train --limit 1000000 --to-db --replace-db
```

If a long run is interrupted, resume from the latest checkpoint:

```bash
python -m src.dewey_prompt_index --dataset allenai/WildChat --split train --limit 1000000 --out-csv data/exports/wildchat_dewey_index.csv --resume --checkpoint-path data/exports/wildchat_dewey_index.checkpoint.json
```

Query indexed prompts by Dewey code and/or keyword:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/dewey-prompts?dewey=000&q=python&limit=50"
```

Frontend browser for this endpoint: `/dewey-prompts`

## 1. Core Research Questions

The platform should answer:

- What are the most common topics users discuss?
- How do interests differ by country?
- How do interests differ by language?
- What questions are trending right now?
- How do trends change over time?
- What topics generate the strongest positive, neutral, or negative sentiment?
- What surprising “wow factor” insights exist in the data?
- What stories can be told from global AI usage patterns?
- What are people asking AI most frequently across the world?
- Which countries show the strongest interest in programming, entrepreneurship, education, finance, health, travel, or AI?

---

---

## 3. Data Sources and Supported Formats

The system is designed to work with WildChat-style global AI conversation data and country-specific extracts.

Supported ingestion formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- Parquet

Large source files should **not** be committed to GitHub. The `.gitignore` excludes raw datasets and large exports.

Example data inputs:

```text
data/raw/wildchat_usa.csv
data/raw/wildchat_canada.csv
data/raw/wildchat_japan.parquet
data/raw/wildchat_global_sample.json
```

---

## 4. Data Pipeline

### Stage 1: Ingestion

Load conversation data from source files.

Requirements:

- Read CSV, JSON, and Parquet
- Support country-level source files
- Support global sample files
- Validate required columns
- Log rejected rows
- Exclude large raw files from version control

### Stage 2: Data Cleaning

Normalize and standardize:

- Countries
- Languages
- Timestamps
- Message formatting
- Missing values
- Duplicate conversations
- Unsafe or toxic records
- Redacted records
- Personally identifiable information

### Stage 3: Data Enrichment

Generate additional metadata:

- Topic classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Language detection
- Country mapping
- Time period grouping
- Question type detection
- Curiosity ranking
- Trending topic indicators

### Stage 4: Translation Layer

Non-English conversations should be translated into English before advanced analysis.

Potential providers:

- Google Cloud Translation API
- DeepL API
- Hugging Face translation models
- LibreTranslate for open-source demos

This enables consistent topic classification across all languages.

Workflow:

```text
Original conversation
        |
        v
Detect language
        |
        v
Translate to English
        |
        v
Run topic classification, sentiment, trend detection
        |
        v
Translate summary back to selected local language
```

### Stage 5: Analytics Storage

Use PostgreSQL for structured, queryable storage.

Core tables:

- countries
- conversations
- conversation_turns
- translations
- topic_classifications
- sentiment_scores
- trend_metrics
- question_patterns
- voice_briefs
- ai_topic_extractions

### Stage 6: Dashboard and AI Features

Use Streamlit as the main dashboard because it works well with Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, Plotly, maps, and fast capstone prototyping.

Dashboard features:

- Global overview
- Interactive world map
- Country analysis
- Language analysis
- Topic explorer
- Sentiment dashboard
- Trend timeline
- Global curiosity index
- Global question heatmap
- Dynamic topic cloud
- Ask the Dataset
- Voice briefing studio

---

## 5. Topic Classification

Classify conversations into categories such as:

- Technology
- Education
- Programming
- Business
- Finance
- Health
- Entertainment
- Science
- Travel
- Lifestyle
- Career and job search
- Writing and communication
- Legal and government
- AI and automation
- Politics and world events
- Other / unclear

Store classifications for dashboard filtering.

Fields:

```text
topic_category
topic_subcategory
topic_confidence
classification_method
classification_model
classified_at
```

---

## 6. AI Topic Extraction

Users should be able to select a subset of conversations and send them to an LLM for deeper analysis.

Example prompt:

```text
Analyze these conversations and identify the five most important topics being discussed.

Return:
1. Top 5 topics
2. Topic summaries
3. Key insights
4. Emerging trends
5. Surprising patterns
6. Suggested story angles for a research report
```

Generated outputs:

- Top 5 topics
- Topic summaries
- Key insights
- Emerging trends
- “Wow factor” observations
- Suggested narrative for presentation

Safety rule:

The LLM should receive cleaned summaries or safe excerpts, not raw sensitive conversation data.

---

## 7. Sentiment Analysis

The platform should analyze sentiment by:

- Country
- Language
- Topic
- Time period

Sentiment labels:

- Positive
- Neutral
- Negative

Fields:

```text
sentiment_label
sentiment_score
sentiment_method
sentiment_model
sentiment_analyzed_at
```

Use sentiment to answer:

- Which topics create the most positive conversation?
- Which topics show user stress, confusion, or frustration?
- Which countries have the highest negative sentiment for job search, finance, or health questions?
- How does sentiment change over time?

---
